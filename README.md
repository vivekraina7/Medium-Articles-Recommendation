# Medium-Articles-Recommendation
### NLP: Finding Similar Medium Articles Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques

1. Developed a recommendation system to suggest similar articles to Medium readers based on the article they are currently reading.
2. Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the relationship between article length, reading time, authors, and topics.
3. Preprocessed the text data by expanding word contractions and converted text into numerical representations using various techniques like One-Hot Encoding, Bag of Words, and TF-IDF.
4. Compared the performance of different text representation techniques based on Euclidean distance and Cosine Similarity metrics.
5. Implemented BOW and TF-IDF techniques to calculate similarity between documents.
6. Visualized the features using T-SNE to understand the patterns in the data.
7. Demonstrated strong skills in NLP, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and data visualization.
8. This project has practical implications for improving the reader experience on Medium and can be extended to other applications like content recommendation and search engines.
